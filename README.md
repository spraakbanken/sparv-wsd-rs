# sparv-wsd-rs

Rewrite of Sparv module sparv-wsd to use [wsd-rs](https://github.com/spraakbanken/wsd-rs) instead.

The binary `saldowsd` from `wsd-rs` can be downloaded from <https://github.com/spraakbanken/wsd-rs/releases>.

An example of the output from `Sparv` can be seen [here](./assets/small/bet-2018-2021-1-short_export.gold.xml)
